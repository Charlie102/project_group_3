        <h3>How To Design A Nail Design Like That ?</h3>
        <p>Creating beautiful nail designs requires regular practice. However, for the simple nail designs for kids, you
            just need to paint the nails with the base color and stick interesting shapes on the nails. Here are the
            instructions for creating them.</p>
        <img src="img/kindofdesign/kids/content1.jpg" style="width:600px; height:500px; margin-left: 50px;"><br><br>
        <ul class="content1">
            <li>Paint your baby's nails with a base coat. It can then be painted in any color like pink, blue, green or
                black. You can also paint different colors on each nail. Make sure you dry the base coat properly,
                before
                applying other colors.</li>
            <li>Nail design takes time and patience. Choose the design you want to draw on your baby's nails. Choose a
                simple design. Sketch this design on paper for reference. You can also color the nail design with colors
                of
                your choice, in case you want to see how it will look when finished.</li>
            <li>Choose a color for the nail design to stand out on top of the base polish. Paint and paint over your
                baby's
                nails with your chosen color.</li>
            <li>Always dry any coats of paint before adding a new one. Painting children's nails is hard work. Here is
                my
                secret. I made a little plastic funnel with a small end and put some paint in it. Then using this funnel
                I
                will draw any intricate shape on the nail easily or you can also use a nail art pen to design.</li>
            <li>To spice up your baby's nails, try these ideas. If she's going to a party, add glitter on her nails. Use
                transparent glitter polish to cover the nail design to create a party atmosphere. If you want more shine
                on
                your nails, apply a glossy top coat over the model. This top coat can help protect your baby's nail
                designs
                .</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lovely Nail Design Ideas:</h3>
        <h5>1. Food pictures on nails</h5>
        <img src="img/kindofdesign/kids/content3.png"><br><br>
        <p>Paint her nails any color she likes, for example bright yellow, dark green or deep pink. Decide what kind of
            food you want to paint on your nails. It can be ice cream, pies, pizza, or fruit like watermelon, pineapple,
            banana, etc.</p>
        <h5>2. Stripe Design</h5>
        <img src="img/kindofdesign/kids/content4.png"><br><br>
        <p>Paint the base color according to the child's liking. Draw straight stripes in the direction you choose. You
            can combine different colors with the background layer and stripes. Some examples are red and white, black
            and white, blue and yellow, etc.</p>
        <h5>3. Seasonal nail designs</h5>
        <img src="img/kindofdesign/kids/content5.png"><br><br>
        <p>To paint a seasonal theme on your baby's nails, try these nail design ideas . On top of the base paint, draw
            a rainbow, an umbrella, a raindrop, a cloud, or any other weather image your child wants. You can also draw
            with a summer theme, like sun, sunglasses, hat, fruit, etc.</p>
        <h5>4. Music on nails</h5>
        <img src="img/kindofdesign/kids/content6.png"><br><br>
        <p>Design any musical instrument such as guitar, piano, flute, etc. for your child to participate in music
            class. Paint your baby's nails with a background color and draw a simple musical instrument design on top.
        </p>
        <h5>5. Personalized nail designs</h5>
        <img src="img/kindofdesign/kids/content7.png"><br><br>
        <p>For this idea you can use a light or dark base paint. Draw different shapes like stars, triangles, hearts,
            squares, etc. You can also decorate your baby's nails with game designs like tic-tac-toe or connect 4.</p>
        <h5>6. Animals on the nails</h5>
        <img src="img/kindofdesign/kids/content8.png"><br><br>
        <p>Paint your child's nails dark green or any fur color. The base coat will add a jungle feel to the nail design
            . On the background layer, draw animals such as bears, monkeys, giraffes, etc.</p>

                            attention to the origin, origin and composition of nail accessories. This ensures the safety

                        <p>The most important thing is the material of the glue used to stick fake nails on the nails,
                            you must choose a high-quality product so that this glue both adheres well to the nail and
                            is not too difficult to remove.</p>
                        <h4>1.2 Regularly take care of children's nails</h4>
                        <p>Nail decoration with artificial nails requires mothers to prepare their children's natural
                            nails in the best conditions. That is, nails must be clean, neatly trimmed to avoid bacteria
                            and infection after attaching fake nails.</p>

                        <p>Parents often choose to buy cheap products because of the perception that accessories for
                            children are often cheaper than for adults. But be aware that a professional acrylic nail
                            set will last a lot longer than a regular nail polish. You can completely reuse it for your
                            baby instead of just being able to use it once and easily peel off the paint during use.</p>

                        <p>The best suggestion is still to go to a professional spa to remove fake nails from acrylic
                            with nail polish. If there are no conditions, to remove the nails, you just need to soak
                            your hands in warm water for 20 minutes to dissolve the glue. Wait for the glue to dry,
                            gently remove the nail from the natural nail and wipe off the glue. If the glue is still
                            left, you can use the polish to cover the cotton pad to wipe it off completely.</p>
