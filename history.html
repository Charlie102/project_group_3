        <h1>The origin of nail art</h1>
    </center>
    <div class="his-content">
        <p><img class="img-history" src="img/hisbc.jpg" alt="History">
            The exact origin of nail treatments is unclear, since it appears to have originated in different parts of
            the
            world around the same time. In ancient Egypt, from 5000 to 3000 BC, women would dye their nails with henna
            to
            indicate social status and seductiveness. Women of the lower class wore pastel and neutral shades, while the
            upper classes wore deep, bright shades. In Babylonia, 3200 BC, men, not women, painted their nails with
            black
            and green kohl, an ancient cosmetic. To prepare for war, warriors of Babylon spent hours having their nails
            prepared, hair curled, and other similar beauty treatments. As in ancient Egypt, nail color indicated one's
            status, black for noblemen and green for the common man. Around the same time, 3000 BC, the first nail
            polish
            originated in ancient China. It was made from beeswax, egg whites, gelatin, vegetable dyes, and gum arabic.
            Chinese dipped their nails in this mixture for several hours or left it on to dry. Colors ranged from pink
            to
            red, depending on the mixture of the ingredients. During the Zhou Dynasty, 600 BC, royalty used this simple
            nail
            polish with gold and silver dust on their nails to show their social status.
        </p><br>
        <p><img class="img-his1" src="img/his2.1.jpg" alt="History">
            The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) was known for extremely long nails. Sometimes, these nails were protected by
            gold- and jewel-encrusted nail guards. Servants performed personal chores for the royals so their nails did
            not
            break or become damaged. Empress Dowager Cixi of China, who ruled from 1835 to 1908, was known for her
            outrageous nails. Many photos show the empress with 6-inch-long gold guards protecting her long nails. All
            of
            the aforementioned did not use nail art as it is widely known today, only stained, dyed, or dusted the
            fingernails and toenails. The first actual record of nail art was from the short-lived Inca Empire
            (1438-1533), which at that time was one of the largest empires in South America. Incas decorated their nails
            by
            painting eagles on them. In 1770, the first fancy gold and silver manicure sets were created. French King
            Louis XVI, who ruled from 1774 until his deposition in 1792, always had his nails taken care of using these
            sets.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            In the early 1800s, the modern manicure developed with the invention of the orange stick, a thin wooden
            stick
            with one pointy end, usually made from orange wood. It was invented in 1830, by Dr. Sitts, a European
            podiatrist, who adapted a dental tool for manicure purposes. Previous to this invention, people used acid, a
            metal rod, and scissors to shape and trim the nails. In 1892, Dr. Sitts' niece invented a nail-care line for
            women of any social class, which eventually reached United States salons. Prior to then, women had short,
            almond-shaped nails and often used oils for additional shine or tint. Not long after, in 1907, the first
            liquid
            nail polish was invented, although it was colorless. Soon thereafter, it was available in variety of
            different
            colors. In 1925, the lunar manicure (today known as the half-moon manicure) was seen everywhere. Reds and
            pinks were used on the nail bed, while avoiding the area around the cuticles. Then again in 1970s, the
            natural look was back in fashion and preferred by many women, but only for a short time. The French manicure
            style was created in Paris in 1976 by Jeff Pink, who was the founder of the Los Angeles-based cosmetic
            company
            ORLY. Nail painting came back in vogue in the 1980s and since then has been extremely popular.

        <h3>1. In popular culture</h3>
        <p><img class="img-his2" src="img/his2.2.jpg">The nail-care industry has been growing like never before ever
            since
            the invention of modern nail polish. In 2012, the United States witnessed a surging popularity of nail
            art. in the same year, a short nail-art documentary was released: "NAILgasm". The film explored the growing
            trend of nail art, from women across the world to high-fashion runways. Mostly women, but also men commonly
            use YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest to learn how to do the newest and most interesting designs at
            home.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>2. Social relevance</h3>
        <p>
            In some cultures, nail art can be tied to the concept of femininity and the sense of belonging in a group of
            females.
            Nail art is also a way to create its own identity through fashion, using colours and shapes as a disruption
            of
            childhood and entering to the female teen/adult world, also leaving the influence of their parents to create
            their own selves.
            The nail is also part of the puzzle of mounting the gender identity, the nails for teenagers and adult women
            represents a piece of the symbol of what is a woman and how the woman should present herself. Though the
            women
            use nail art to express their womanliness, the different types of art define as a woman with particular
            personality, as using French manicure (delicate) or using black nails (aggressive).
            The trend of metrosexual (term first said in 1994, but became a trend a decade later) men in the 2000s
            brought
            to the males also the sensibility of taking care of their hands and nails. As David Beckham, demonstrating
            how a
            football player, a husband, and a father could also take care of himself, showed men that they could also
            invest
            money and time in appearance and still keep their masculinity.[citation needed]
            Before the metrosexual trend, the punk subculture used the black nail polish in a “dirty” way to show how
            rebellious they were against social rules, with the nail polish in a role of showing their disdain to any
            rules
            and meant to shock the society.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Media</h3>
        <p>Nail art’s popularity in media started with printed press with women magazines. It had an important role, but
            it
            was not a mainstream fashion trend before the 2000s. After the internet age and the common use of the social
            media, the trend became major subculture among women. Social media made it easier to connect to the mass
            audience, and with this, people started to share their designs as a way of their creativity and use the nail
            as
            their blank canvas. YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter are the major platforms, which
            provide
            many new ideas and designs for the subculture. However, among these, Pinterest is the most important
            platform
            for the new beauty trends according to a study.</p>
        <h3>4. Techniques and tools</h3>
        <p>Manicurists start with the same techniques as for the manicure or pedicure:</p>
        <li>Acrylics: a chemical mixture of monomer liquid and polymer powder that can be directly applied on the nails
            or on artificial nails also called nails extensions or enhancements.</li>
        <li>Nail gel: a chemical combination similar to acrylics, also known as shellac nails. Manicurist applies
            several layers on the fingernails or/and toenails and lets it cure under a UV or LED light. When the gel is
            cured it
            hardens the nails. Gel is also common in a polish form known as gel polish, and, like other forms of gel,
            also requires a UV or LED light to cure. The difference between acrylic and gel is that acrylic dries
            naturally
            but gel needs UV light to cure. Similarly, where regular nail polish will dry naturally, gel polish will
            remain
            tacky until cured by a UV light.</li>
        <li>Nail polish/nail varnish: a lacquer applied to finger and toe nails to protect or as a base color. Nail
            manicurists also use a base coat to protect and strengthen nails, as well as preventing the natural nail
            from yellowing or staining.</li>
        <p>Several options are available for decorating nails:</p>
        <li>Glitters</li>
        <li>Nail art pens</li>
        <li>Piercing</li>
        <li>Stamping</li>
        <li>Water Decals</li>
        <li>Water marbling</li>
        <li>Adding accessories</li>
        <li>Studs, rhinestones, miniature plastic bow-ties, beads, dried flowers and aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Acrylic powder for 3D art. The powder used for 3D acrylic nail art is a polymer powder which is used with a
            monomer liquid to create designs.</li>
        <p>To decorate the nails, manicurists use several tools, such as:</p>
        <li>Nail dotters, also known as "dotting tools"</li>
        <li>Nail art brushes</li>
        <li>Stationery tape/ stickers</li>
        <li>Thin, colored striping tape</li>
        <li>Sponges (for gradient effects)</li>
        <p>Do-it-yourself (DIY) is a new concept of doing nail art without the aid of experts or professionals. One of
            the ways of doing a DIY design is by using home tools such as toothpicks, earbuds, cellophane tape, etc., or
            a
            tool set with dotted tools, brushes, and nail-art pens.</p>

        <h3>5. Innovations</h3>
        <p><img class="img-his3" src="img/his2.3.jpg">Some brands try to innovate by creating new kinds of nail polish.
        </p>
        <li>Textures: microbeads or caviar beads are applied just before the nail polish becomes dry. These textures
            give a sand-like texture to the nail.</li>
        <li>Holographic effect: Polishes with holographic finishes give off flashy rainbow reflections when exposed to
            light. Multi-chrome nail art with star-shaped nail vinyl stencils.</li>
        <li>Velvet manicure: Velvet fibers called velveteen are sprinkled onto wet polish. The excess is gently brushed
            off, leaving behind a fuzzy velvet feel.</li>
        <li>Crackle effect: Nail polish pioneer brand Sally Hansen created the first "crackle" effect polish. Acting as
            an overcoat, a crackle polish is applied onto already-painted nails and dries to a shattered or cracked
            effect. <img class="img-his3" src="img/his2.4.jpg"></li>
        <li>Thermochromic polish: The nail polish changes color when exposed to hot or cold temperatures.</li>
        <li>Matte effect: These nail polishes can transform a layer of glossy nail polish into a flat matte finish.</li>
        <li>Inverse French: Also called a "half-moon". The half-moon is created on the root of the nail in one color
            while the rest of the nail is painted a different color.</li>
        <li>Nail stickers: A form of artificial nails, there is a large range of nail stickers, strips and wraps on the
            market used to mimic nail polish without exposing oneself to the harmful chemicals found in polish.</li>
