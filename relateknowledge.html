                    <center><img src="img/relate/relate1.jpg"></center>
                    <p>Although it is never desirable, many times a manicure at low-quality nail salons can cause you to
                        get an infection.</p>
                    <p>Due to the sharing of nail clipping and trimming tools, this is believed to be an intermediary of
                        hepatitis B, C or HIV virus infection or simply a common fungus.</p>
                    <p>To avoid getting infected, experts recommend that you buy your own set of nail trimming tools.
                        Don't be afraid to bring this kit with you every time you do your nails, clean them carefully
                        before and after use - because after all, it's about protecting your health.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-2">2. Remove calluses, exfoliate feet</h4>
                    <center><img src="img/relate/relate2.jpg"></center>
                    <p>Experts recommend that, even if you have calluses on your feet, they should not be removed at a
                        nail salon.</p>
                    <p>Especially if you have thin skin, the technician can accidentally scratch it, creating a chance
                        for infection. To avoid calluses, you should not wear shoes that are too tight, and remember to
                        apply moisturizer to your feet to keep them soft and smooth.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-3">3. Ingrown toenails</h4>
                    <center><img src="img/relate/relate3.jpg"></center>
                    <p>Ingrown toenails mainly occur in the toenails. The cause is usually because we cut our toenails
                        too often, cut deep, cut improperly â€¦ </p>
                    <p>When cutting close to the two sides of the nail, it will irritate the rest of the nail, causing
                        the nail to grow inwards, penetrating the flesh... The treatment of ingrown nails requires a
                        professional doctor, not the experts. The "artist" in the nail salon can make the situation even
                        worse.</p>
                    <p>The wrong treatment of an ingrown toenail can lead to an infection, even the removal of the
                        entire nail. So do not delay going to the doctor when there are signs of swelling, flaking in
                        the nail.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-4">4. Ingrown toenails</h4>
                    <center><img src="img/relate/relate4.jpg"></center>
                    <p>Surely many people when doing nails ask the manicurist to trim off the cuticle surrounding the
                        nail. But this is a bad habit because the cuticle that surrounds each nail is part of your skin.
                    </p>
                    <p>Trying to get rid of them is that you are breaking the barrier, opening the door for bacteria to
                        freely enter the body. </p>
                    <p>Besides, no one can be sure when removing this cuticle, you will not be scratched. This small
                        scratch will create a great opportunity for bacteria to enter the wound, causing nail infection,
                        even blood infection.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-5">5. Ingrown toenails</h4>
                    <center><img src="img/relate/relate5.jpg"></center>
                    <p>According to Dr. Marie-Pierre Hill-Sylvestre, wet nails are cut better when they are dry, and
                        when wet nails are easier to remove the dirt that is still attached to the nails.</p>
                    <p>However, filing nails is different. When the nails meet the water, they will become softer and
                        weaker, the nail file at this time will accidentally damage the nail, not shaping the nail.
                        Therefore, it is better to file your nails while they are still dry - they will be stronger.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-6">6. Ingrown toenails</h4>
                    <center><img src="img/relate/relate6.jpg"></center>
                    <p>Nail polish, especially those of unknown origin, often contain a variety of chemicals, if applied
                        too often plus the choice of poor quality paint - nails quickly become yellow, darkened. </p>
                    <p>In addition, the chemical ingredients in nail polish can cause you to have allergies, asthma. To
                        make sure you stay safe, experts recommend only changing your nail polish color every three to
                        four weeks and taking a break every six to eight months. Ideally, the break should be 105 days,
                        which is the time for new nails to grow.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-7">7. Ingrown toenails</h4>
                    <center><img src="img/relate/relate7.jpg"></center>
                    <p>Research published in the Australian Journal of Dermatology has shown that using a UV nail lamp
                        to dry gel nails has the potential to lead to skin cancer.</p>
                    <p>An expert from the University of Galway (Ireland) explained that, although the UV rays from the
                        nail lamp are quite low and the customers are only exposed to it for a relatively short period
                        of time, the damage from this UV light also increases with time. </p>
                    <p>If you apply gel nail polish continuously, exposed to a lot of UV rays, you have to accept that
                        the skin on your hands can quickly be wrinkled, aging. Therefore, you should choose a store that
                        uses LED lights to dry your gel nails.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-8">8. Pale Nails</h4>
                    <p>The problem isn't so black and white when it comes to white nails. If your fingernail beds are
                        looking a little ghostly, you may have anemia, a blood disorder characterized by a low red blood
                        cell count. "Anemia resulting from low levels of iron can lead to inadequate oxygen in the
                        blood, which causes the skin and tissues to become pale, particularly the tissues under the
                        nails," says Shilpi Agarwal, M.D., a board-certified family medicine and integrative and
                        holistic medicine physician in Los Angeles. Be sure you're consuming good sources of iron,
                        including green leafy vegetables, beans, and red meat, to boost your levels.</p>
                    <p>More seriously, pale nails could also be a sign of early diabetes or liver disease, both of which
                        can lead to impaired blood flow. "When diagnosed early, diabetes can often be controlled with
                        dietary changes," Dr. Agarwal says. Avoid processed foods with refined sugars and carbs, and eat
                        more fiber, vegetables, and whole grains. "These will help stabilize blood sugar levels and
                        limit circulatory damage caused by uncontrolled sugar levels," she says. For liver disease, a
                        trip to the doc for testing is a must-do for accurate diagnosis.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-9">9. Yellowing or Thickening</h4>
                    <p>Yellow nails certainly don't look pretty, and what causes the hue is even grosser: "Thickened
                        nails, with or without a yellow-ish tone, are characteristic of fungal infections that generally
                        traverse the entire nail bed," Dr. Agarwal says. She adds that topical medication is often no
                        help since the infection is in the nail bed and underlying nail plate. Your doctor can prescribe
                        an oral med, which will reach the entire breadth of the infected nail.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-10">10. Dark Lines</h4>
                    <p>Even if you diligently check your skin for questionable moles monthly, you likely overlook your
                        nails, a place where dangerous melanoma often goes unnoticed. "Dark brown or black vertical
                        lines on the nail bed should never be ignored," Dr. Agarwal warns. "These can be a hallmark sign
                        of melanoma, which requires early detection and treatment."</p>
                    <p>Leave your nails bare periodically so you can examine them, then go get a mani. "Sunlight is
                        unable to penetrate through polish, so any shade other than a clear coat will provide an
                        adequate barrier from the sun," Dr. Agarwal says. Smart idea since your nails' smooth surface
                        makes it hard for sunscreen to be absorbed into the nail.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-11">11. Pitting and Grooving</h4>
                    <p>Depressions and small cracks in your nails are known as "pitting" of the nail bed and are often
                        associated with psoriasis, an inflammatory disease that leads to scaly or red patches all over
                        the body. "Individuals who suffer from psoriasis develop clusters of cells along the nail bed
                        that accumulate and disrupt the linear, smooth growth of a normal nail," Dr. Agarwal explains.
                        "As these cells are sloughed off, grooves or depressed areas are left behind on the surface." A
                        physical exam is often all you need for a diagnosis, after which your doctor may recommend
                        topical, oral, or injected medications or light therapy.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-12">12. Brittle, Thin, or Lifted Nails</h4>
                    <p>Breaking a nail can be a bummer, but if your tips seem to crack at the slightest touch, it could
                        mean your thyroid is amiss. This gland in your neck regulates metabolism, energy, and growth,
                        and too little thyroid hormone often leads to hair loss, brittle and thin nails, and nails that
                        grow slowly, Dr. Agarwal says.</p>
                    <p>Thyroid disorder also manifests itself by causing your nail plate to separate from the nail bed
                        in a noticeable way. "Lifted nails are thought to occur because the increase in thyroid hormone
                        can accelerate cell turnover and separate the nail from its natural linear growth pattern," Dr.
                        Agarwal explains.</p>
                    <p>Brittle, thin, slow-growing, or lifted, see your physician ASAP for a simple blood test that can
                        check for thyroid disorder, which can be treated with medications.</p>

                    <h4 id="item-13">13. White Lines</h4>
                    <p>Stripes on your nails are only a good thing if they are painted on. Horizontal white lines that
                        span the entire nail, are paired, and appear on more than one nail are called Muehrcke's lines.
                        These could be an indication of kidney disease, liver abnormalities, or a lack of protein and
                        other nutrients, Dr. Agarwal says. "They are thought to be caused by a disruption in blood
                        supply to the nail bed because of underlying disease," she explains.</p>
                    <p>Shorter horizontal white marks or streaks, however, are likely just the result of trauma to the
                        base of your nail. These may last from weeks to months and usually will disappear on their own.

                    <h4 id="item-14">14. Blue Nails</h4>
                    <p>A blue face is a clear indication that someone's lacking airflow, and blue nails mean the same
                        thing-you're not getting enough oxygen to your fingertips. This could be caused by respiratory
                        disease or a vascular problem called Raynaud's Disease, which is a rare disorder of the blood
                        vessels, according to Dr. Agarwal. Some people just have slower blood circulation, especially
                        when exposed to cold temperatures, she says, but have a physician check your blood and
                        oxygenation levels if your nails are persistently blue.</p>
